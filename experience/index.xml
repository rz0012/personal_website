      <description>Efficient Object Tracking in the Wild Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training.</description>

      <description>Online Stochastic Optimization for Data with Temporal Dependencies Description This project tackles the problem of online optimization when the data has high temporal correspondence. I co-designed an online stochastic optimization approach with Shivang Patel.
Agents operating in the open-world sense data streams that are non-stationary and temporally correlated, from which they need to quickly learn new knowledge to adapt and be resilient to the changing environment they explore. Current learning-based vision approaches are not designed for agents operating in real-time in the open-world.</description>

      <description>Few-shot adaptation for morphology-independent cell instance segmentation Description Microscopy data collections are becoming larger and more frequent. Accurate and precise quantitative analysis tools like cell instance segmentation are necessary to benefit from them. This is challenging due to the variability in the data, which requires retraining the segmentation model to maintain high accuracy on new collections. This is needed especially for segmenting cells with elongated and non-convex morphology like bacteria. We propose to reduce the amount of annotation and computing power needed for retraining the model by introducing a few-shot domain adaptation approach that requires annotating only one to five cells of the new data to process and that quickly adapts the model to maintain high accuracy.</description>

      <description>Celltranspose: Few-shot domain adaptation for cellular instance segmentation Description Automated cellular instance segmentation is a process utilized for accelerating biological research for the past two decades, and recent advancements have produced higher quality results with less effort from the biologist. Most current endeavors focus on completely cutting the researcher out of the picture by generating highly generalized models. However, these models invariably fail when faced with novel data, distributed differently than the ones used for training.</description>

      <description>Fine-grained visual classification of plant species in the wild: Object detection as a reinforced means of attention Description Plant species identification in the wild is a difficult problem in part due to the high variability of the input data, but also because of complications induced by the long-tail effects of the datasets distribution. Inspired by the most recent fine-grained visual classification approaches which are based on attention to mitigate the effects of data variability, we explore the idea of using object detection as a form of attention.</description>
