      <description>The book explores the importance of intellectual curiosity and openness to new ideas in today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced, constantly changing world. The book argues that we often fall into the trap of overconfidence and close-mindedness, and that cultivating a willingness to challenge our own beliefs and assumptions is essential for success. The book offers practical strategies for developing intellectual curiosity and staying open to new ideas, and is based on Grant&amp;rsquo;s research in psychology and management.</description>
