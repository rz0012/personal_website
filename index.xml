      <description>Efficient Object Tracking in the Wild Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training.</description>

      <title>Building trust through incident communication with Adri√°n Moreno, VP of Engineering at SumUp</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, good incident communication isn&amp;rsquo;t a nice to have‚Äîit&amp;rsquo;s an absolute must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where do you even start? To help answer that question, we sat down with the VP of Engineering at SumUp, ‚Å†Adri√°n Moreno Pe√±a‚Å†, to get his perspective on how organizations of all sizes can share stellar comms no matter the situation. We discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it means to communicate during incidents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Status Pages are critical in helping to build trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can have good comms even without a lead
&amp;hellip;and much more&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>Online Stochastic Optimization for Data with Temporal Dependencies Description This project tackles the problem of online optimization when the data has high temporal correspondence. I co-designed an online stochastic optimization approach with Shivang Patel.
Agents operating in the open-world sense data streams that are non-stationary and temporally correlated, from which they need to quickly learn new knowledge to adapt and be resilient to the changing environment they explore. Current learning-based vision approaches are not designed for agents operating in real-time in the open-world.</description>

      <description>Few-shot adaptation for morphology-independent cell instance segmentation Description Microscopy data collections are becoming larger and more frequent. Accurate and precise quantitative analysis tools like cell instance segmentation are necessary to benefit from them. This is challenging due to the variability in the data, which requires retraining the segmentation model to maintain high accuracy on new collections. This is needed especially for segmenting cells with elongated and non-convex morphology like bacteria. We propose to reduce the amount of annotation and computing power needed for retraining the model by introducing a few-shot domain adaptation approach that requires annotating only one to five cells of the new data to process and that quickly adapts the model to maintain high accuracy.</description>

      <description>Celltranspose: Few-shot domain adaptation for cellular instance segmentation Description Automated cellular instance segmentation is a process utilized for accelerating biological research for the past two decades, and recent advancements have produced higher quality results with less effort from the biologist. Most current endeavors focus on completely cutting the researcher out of the picture by generating highly generalized models. However, these models invariably fail when faced with novel data, distributed differently than the ones used for training.</description>

      <title>Tech Leaders Journal: How to balance independence and control within your organization</title>
      <link>https://ramzaveri.netlify.app/public-speaking/2022-03-17-tech-leaders-hub-independence-control/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlock the secrets to striking the perfect balance between independence and control within your organization with Adri√°n Moreno Pe√±a, Director of Engineering at SumUp, in this episode of Tech Leaders Hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 4 million vendors relying on their products, SumUp is a leading provider of financial services for small businesses. As the Director of Engineering, Adrian leads a team of over 50 people, including 30+ engineers, responsible for the development of online invoicing and accounting tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges facing Adrian and his team is how to balance the need for individual growth with the needs of the larger organization. By focusing on helping others grow and succeed, Adrian has been able to foster a culture of collaboration and success within his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this episode, we explored topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to foster a culture of innovation and sustainability within a larger organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of allowing smaller units to operate with a startup mentality within a company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of setting clear investments and goals for each unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of teaching and mentoring in fostering growth and development within a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategies for balancing the needs of the individual with the needs of the larger organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>Fine-grained visual classification of plant species in the wild: Object detection as a reinforced means of attention Description Plant species identification in the wild is a difficult problem in part due to the high variability of the input data, but also because of complications induced by the long-tail effects of the datasets distribution. Inspired by the most recent fine-grained visual classification approaches which are based on attention to mitigate the effects of data variability, we explore the idea of using object detection as a form of attention.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Graduation speech for the students of graduating in 2012 in Computer Engineering in my university, Santiago de Compostela. After graduating in 2007 and having started a company since then, I got the chance to participate in the graduation ceremomy with a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best thing is that I thought that the &amp;ldquo;inspirational quote&amp;rdquo; that I used to close the speech was from Steve Jobs - as I had seen attributed in Wikiquote. But it turned to be a joke added to the page - where the quote itself is from a Digimon son ü§∑ (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter-Fly&#34;&gt;Butter-Fly&lt;/a&gt;, in particular).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I liked how it could result counter-intuitive, but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s best to avoid competition at all, and find a market that is underserved (blue ocean), instead of starting a fight in a proven, competed one (red ocean).</description>

      <description>An exploration of alternative ways of organizing companies - focusing on how to create more adaptive and human organizations in the face of complexity and uncertainty. Dignan argues that the traditional way of working based on hierarchy, bureaucracy and control is outdated and ineffective. Instead, it proposes a new operating system (OS) for work that is based on principles such as autonomy, experimentation, transparency and purpose. It has good practical tools and examples to help with transformation - and specific industry examples (like Gore)</description>

It served me to realize that once you&amp;rsquo;re managing people - that has to be the main priority, and the IC track (ie: fixing problems, developing) comes to a second place, or you end being a very weak and non present manager.</description>

      <guid>https://ramzaveri.netlify.app/book/thinking-fast-and-slow/</guid>

The book is based on Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s research in psychology and behavioral economics, and offers insights into how our minds work and how we can improve our decision-making skills.</description>
